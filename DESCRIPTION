Description: Facilitates nonresponse bias analysis (NRBA) 
    for survey data.  Such data may arise from a complex
    sampling design with features such as stratification, clustering, or
    unequal probabilities of selection. Multiple types of analyses may be
    conducted: comparisons of response rates across subgroups; comparisons
    of estimates before and after weighting adjustments; comparisons of
    sample-based estimates to external population totals; tests of
    systematic differences in covariate means between respondents
    and full samples; tests of independence between response status
    and covariates; and modeling of outcomes and response status as a 
    function of covariates. Extensive documentation and references are
    provided for each type of analysis. Krenzke, Van de Kerckhove,
